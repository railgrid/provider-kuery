Fleet-wide object search, relationship traversal, and impact analysis across
the edge clusters connected to a railgrid workspace — built on
[kuery](https://github.com/railgrid/kuery), a multi-cluster query engine that
syncs objects into a local SQL store and answers relationship queries
(owners, descendants, spec references, selector matches, cross-cluster
links) that plain list/watch can't.

The full design — architecture, tenant isolation, the Enable-time
edges-proxy grant, value ranking, and phasing — lives in the railgrid repo at
[`docs/kuery-provider-architecture.md`](../../docs/kuery-provider-architecture.md).

## Status: Phase 2 — fleet query engine

What works today:

- **Embedded kuery engine** (`core/`): SQLite (default, on the chart's
  PVC) or Postgres store, the query engine, the multi-cluster sync
  controller, and the stale-cluster GC. Sync is whitelist-driven — the
  chart defaults to the workloads/config/RBAC/networking set
  (`sync.whitelist`); non-whitelisted types stay discoverable but ship no
  objects.
- **Edge engagement** (`engagement/`): watches `Edge` objects across every
  tenant workspace that Enabled the provider (APIExport virtual
  workspace), and syncs each connected kubernetes edge through the hub's
  edges-proxy as the workspace-local `railgrid-kuery` ServiceAccount the
  controller provisions there (the `railgrid-kuery-edgeproxy` grant gives it
  verb `proxy` on kubernetesclusters). Engaged clusters are keyed
  `{clusterID}/{edgeName}` and labelled with their tenant, where the tenant
  key is the tenant workspace's **kcp logical-cluster ID** (read from the
  kuery `APIBinding`'s `kcp.io/cluster` annotation) — never a workspace
  path. Rows nobody re-asserts for five minutes (a replica killed without a
  disengage, or rows written under an older key format) are marked stale so
  kuery's GC reaps them within their TTL; a running store converges on its
  own.
- **Tenant-scoped query API** (`queryapi/`): `POST /api/query` takes a
  kuery `QuerySpec`; the cluster filter is force-rewritten to the caller's
  tenant cluster ID before it reaches the engine — the only path to the
  store. The identity is `X-Railgrid-Cluster` (the hub injects it on every
  proxied REST and MCP request); `X-Railgrid-Tenant` is accepted only when it
  carries the same cluster ID, and a workspace path there is rejected with
  a 400. Query results report `objects[].cluster` as `{clusterID}/{edge}`.
- **MCP tools** (`mcpserver/`): `kuery_query` (fleet-wide spec
  passthrough) and `kuery_impact` (declared blast radius of one object) at
  `/mcp` + `/mcp/sse`.
- **Portal UI** (`portal/`): fleet inventory table (edge/kind/namespace/
  name filters, click-through) and the impact view — the declared blast
  radius of one object, grouped by relation. Edge selector fed by
  `GET /api/edges` (engaged edges for the caller's tenant: `edges` are the
  bare names, `clusters` the `{clusterID}/{edge}` keys, `tenant` the ID).
- **Registration surface** from Phase 1: heartbeats, CatalogEntry
  (SavedView schema, `edges` claim, `edgeProxyAccess`), Helm chart.

What lands next (see the design doc): an e2e suite asserting edge-object
sync end to end with a real connected agent, SavedView reconciliation,
and — as a later enhancement — the cytoscape object graph.

## Layout

```
main.go          serve loop: healthz, /api/query, /api/edges, /api/status, /mcp, portal, heartbeat
core/            embedded kuery wiring (store, engine, sync, gc)
engagement/      Edge watcher → Engage/Disengage via the edges-proxy
queryapi/        tenant-scoped POST /api/query (the store's only entry point)
mcpserver/       kuery_query + kuery_impact MCP tools
assets.go        //go:embed of portal/dist
manifest.yaml    CatalogEntry (SavedView schema, edges claim, edgeProxyAccess)
portal/          Vite + TS micro-frontend (custom element)
deploy/chart/    Helm chart (host cluster only; PVC for the SQLite store)
```

## Deploying to a cluster (Helm)

The provider runs on the **host cluster** and registers itself into the hub.
The chart is published as an OCI artifact at
`oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-kuery-provider`.

### Prerequisites

- A reachable railgrid hub (`hub.url`).
- A **provider kubeconfig** — the workspace-admin kubeconfig minted via the
  admin onboarding flow (`/bonkers`). Stored as a Secret whose key **must be
  `kubeconfig`**.
- The `edges` APIExport identity hash from the hub
  (`apiExport.edgesIdentityHash`) so the provider can bind the `edges`
  permission claim.
- For the Postgres store: a running PostgreSQL with a Secret exposing a
  connection `uri` (e.g. a CloudNativePG cluster, whose `*-app` Secret carries
  `uri`). Skip this for the default SQLite store.

### 1. Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace railgrid-prod-provider-kuery
```

### 2. Provider kubeconfig Secret

The key **must** be `kubeconfig` (this matches the chart default
`providerKubeconfig.secretName=railgrid-provider-kubeconfig`):

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-prod-provider-kuery create secret generic railgrid-provider-kubeconfig \
  --from-file=kubeconfig="railgrid/provider-kuery.kubeconfig"
```

### 3. (Postgres only) build the DSN

Read the connection URI from the database Secret and require TLS:

```bash
DSN="$(kubectl -n railgrid-prod-provider-kuery get secret kuery-pg-app \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.uri}' | base64 -d)?sslmode=require"
echo "$DSN"
```

### 4. Install / upgrade

```bash
helm upgrade --install kuery oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-kuery-provider:0.0.8 \
  -n railgrid-prod-provider-kuery \
  --set image.tag=v0.0.8 \
  --set hub.url=https://railgrid-railgrid-hub.railgrid-prod.svc.cluster.local:9443 \
  --set hub.insecure=true \
  --set hub.tokenSecretRef.name="" \
  --set apiExport.edgesIdentityHash="<identity-hash>" \
  --set catalogEntry.enabled=true \
  --set store.driver=postgres \
  --set store.persistence.enabled=false \
  --set-string store.dsn="$DSN"
```

Key flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `image.tag` | Provider image version (match the chart release). |
| `hub.url` | In-cluster hub address. |
| `hub.insecure` | Skip hub TLS verification (in-cluster, self-signed). |
| `hub.tokenSecretRef.name=""` | No static hub token — auth is via the provider kubeconfig. |
| `apiExport.edgesIdentityHash` | Hub's `edges` APIExport identity, for the permission claim. |
| `catalogEntry.enabled=true` | Init container self-registers the CatalogEntry. |
| `store.driver` | `postgres` or `sqlite` (default). |
| `store.persistence.enabled` | PVC for the SQLite store; set `false` with Postgres. |
| `store.dsn` | Postgres DSN (use `--set-string`, it contains `:`/`?`/`&`). |

For the **default SQLite store**, drop the `store.*` Postgres flags and set
`store.driver=sqlite` with `store.persistence.enabled=true` (the chart mounts a
PVC at `/data`).

### 5. Verify

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-prod-provider-kuery rollout status deploy/kuery-railgrid-kuery-provider
kubectl -n railgrid-prod-provider-kuery logs deploy/kuery-railgrid-kuery-provider -c provider --tail=50
```

A healthy provider logs `updated endpointslice object` and serves
`GET /healthz`. Connect an edge in a tenant workspace that Enabled the
provider, then open the Kuery portal tab.

## Local development

From the railgrid repo root:

```bash
make build-kuery-provider        # portal build + go build
make run-provider-kuery          # run against a local hub
make install-provider-kuery      # apply manifest.yaml to embedded kcp
```

## Tilt

Both Tiltfiles (embedded-kcp `Tiltfile` and in-cluster `Tiltfile.cluster`)
include a `providers-kuery` group:

1. `kuery` — builds + serves on :8084 (auto-restarts on source change).
2. ▶ `kuery-register` — applies the CatalogEntry; the hub provisions the
   workspace, APIExport, SA, and token.
3. ▶ `kuery-init` — mints `.kcp/kuery-runtime.kubeconfig` from the
   provider SA token and ensures the APIExportEndpointSlice; Tilt then
   restarts `kuery` with edge engagement enabled.
4. Connect an edge and open the portal — the Kuery tab shows the fleet
   inventory. (▶ `kuery-unregister` tears the CatalogEntry down.)

## Running it yourself

This provider can run in your own cluster instead of on the platform. railgrid
creates a workspace for it in your organization, mints a credential scoped to
that workspace alone, and generates the exact `helm` commands — under
**Providers → Self-Hosting** in the portal.

Nothing to fill in: the edges identity hash it claims against is resolved for
you. kuery reads through edges, so self-hosting it usually means self-hosting
`edges` as well — do that first and kuery will bind to your own instance.

Once installed, the provider registers itself and your workspaces enable it
exactly like the platform copy. See
[docs/byo-providers.md](../../docs/byo-providers.md) for how the flow works, and
[deploy/chart/README.md](deploy/chart/README.md) for every chart value.
